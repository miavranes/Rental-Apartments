## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Stripe account (for payments)
- Gmail account (for email verification)

### Backend Setup
```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create `backend/.env` (copy from `backend/.env.example`):

```env
PORT=5000
DB_USER=postgres
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_NAME=rental_apartments
DB_PASSWORD=your_password
DB_PORT=5432
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
EMAIL_USER=your@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your_app_password
```

Run database setup (PostgreSQL must be running):

```bash
createdb rental_apartments
psql -U postgres -d rental_apartments -f backend/db/schema.sql
psql -U postgres -d rental_apartments -f backend/db/seedAmenities.sql
```

Or in **pgAdmin**: create database `rental_apartments`, then run `backend/db/schema.sql` and `backend/db/seedAmenities.sql` in Query Tool.

Start backend:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Frontend Setup
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
